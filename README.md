<p align="justify">
A custom <A href="https://www.debian.org/index.el.html"> Debian Linux </A> ISO, preconfigured, to help administrators install and run a Samba 4 server in Hellenic Public Sector in just a few minutes. The installation is semi automated and making use of the preseeding method. All the files and the ISO are published under GNU General Public License v3.0, so you can check everything. During installation you will need to choose only the root password and the partition/s where the system will be installed.

**What's in the bootable iso?? Check below...** (based on Debian Linux 9.0.1 netinstall)
  1. Samba 4 (with Recycle Bin per share and Full Audit - log a lot)
  2. Webmin (administrate the server easier, best for linux beginners)
  3. Fail2ban (trying to protect data from ransomware malicious software)
  4. Rsync (bash scripts with rsync so you can create backups easily)
  5. WebDAV CGI (Hmm, so everything might be on the web... Maybe in next release!)
  5. Many more will come...
